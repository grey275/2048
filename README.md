# 2048

This is an older project of mine which I built almost 3 years ago, when I was still very new to programming.
It's a crude terminal based recreation of the popular phone game 2048, as well as some half-built tools for performing some simulations.
There are are no install instructions to speak of and it only works in windows(if it still works at all) and I don't have a windows machine currently available to test it, but if you want to take a peek at some of my early code, then by all means!
